# Smoke Signal

Smoke Signal is a live status/group activities social media app. Currently, Smoke Signal has no official release. With a little Firebase elbow-grease the code here can be used to side-load Smoke Signal.

It is intended for Smoke Signal to have an official release. If you would like to expedite that process, see [Contributing](#Contributing)

## Ingredients

The front end is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), which allows for instant (ish) cross platform development. The back end is built with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which has all the pros/cons of a [BaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/backend-as-a-service-baas/). For Smoke Signal, we're happy to start with Firebase for the great Flutter libraries (both are Google products) and the solid [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing).

The plan is to migrate Smoke Signal to run on the [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) platform, then release it on the official App Stores.
